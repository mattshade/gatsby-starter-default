    <h1>The Shade's 2020 Covid RV Road Trip Vacation</h1>
    <p>The Shade family likes to travel. Under normal circumstances we use birthdays as an excuse to explore somewhere new. It was very  near Aidan's birthday so we came up with a plan. Our next adventure was supposed to be held somewhere in the nordic countries, perhaps Switzerland, but with Covid-19 we had to think of something more safe. We wanted to avoid confined places and hotels so we thought road trip was the best option and decided to rent an RV!</p>
    <h3>Day 1</h3>
    <p>We made a reservation and headed down to <a href={'https://www.elmonterv.com'}>El Monte RV</a> to pick up this sweet ride:</p>
    <img src={`${RV1}`} alt='El  Monte'/>
    <img src={`${RV2}`} alt='El  Monte'/>
    <p>Yup! We got the Leprechaun! Or maybe it got us...</p>
    <p>El Monte RV is located at an awful location in Linden, NJ. For me Linden is now the armpit of New Jersey. The checkout time was pretty long(over an hour), and since they are practicing social distancing be prepared to stand outside in the heat right next to RT. 95!</p>
    <p>After making it through the lengthy checkout process we parked our car at nearby <a href={'https://winsorsdriving.com/'}>Winsor's tractor trailer driving school</a> since El Monte did not offer parking, then we headed off to PA.</p>
    <p>It was pretty late in the afternoon, and our first destination was somewhere in the Amish community of Ohio so we just focused on making it as far as we could before calling it quits for the day. We made it out to Nescopeck when it started to get near dinner, and I wanted to find a place to park before it got dark. For this trip we made zero reservations as this strategy has worked well for us in the past on road trips in Europe.</p>
    <p>Finding our first camping spot was a little scary as it seemed like nothing was available, and we seriously considered parking in a spot by the Susquehanna river.</p>

    <p>Luckily there was a really nice woman working at <a href={'https://bodnarosacampground.com/'}>Bondarosa Campground</a> that made a call to her boss on our behalf, and we were able to secure the spot right next to the dumpster. We found a nice pizza at <a href={'https://www.facebook.com/pages/Stuccios-Pizzeria/120774534604827'}>Stuccio's</a> and settled in.</p>
    <img src={stuccios} alt={'stuccio\'s'}/>
    <p>This was my first attempt at parking the RV and hooking up to the electric, water, and sewer. Water and sewer were no problem, and I thought what could be easier than plugging into the electric? Turns out the electric boxes have breaker switches on them which I did not see and  failed to turn our power on. It  was already dark at this point, and I had no idea why the power was not working, so we ended up running the camper for most of the night for the A/C. The cab of the camper is not powerful enough to supply a good flow of air to the whole camper so we sweated that one out.</p>
    <h3>Day 2</h3>
    <p>The next morning we started up the generator, blasted the A/C, and got back on the road to Ohio! We had some road food<sup>*</sup> for lunch and after a few hours we were dodging horse drawn buggies while cruising through the rolling hills of an Amish community, and reached our destination at the <a href={'http://timbercrestrvpark.com/'}>TimberCrest RV Park</a> in Millersburg, OH.</p>
    <p>It was pretty late in the afternoon, so we decided to go to the grocery and cooked up some hamburgers and hot dogs for dinner. Usually I try to make culinary experiences a main focus on our vacations, but because we were traveling mostly in the boonies I had to curb the gastronome in me, but I was able to supplement by exploring the local beers and wines.</p>
    <p>I don't go crazy for the citra hopped beers. I like a more refreshing beer without all of the tropical piney flavors, so I mainly stick to pilsners, lagers, and pale ales. The highlight for  this day was a double whammy. Platform Beer Company's New Cleveland Palesner, yum!</p>
    <img src={palesner} alt={'Platform Beer Company New Cleveland Palesner'}/>
    <h3>Day 3</h3>
    <p>On Day 3 the camper threw a wrench into the mix, literally:</p>
    <img src={wrench} alt={'Wrench warning light'}/>
    <p>So we got this wrench icon which is similar to a check engine light indicating some drive train service needs to be made. One thing that happens when this light comes on is the shift lever locks up and prevents you from shifting the camper into gear. We were stuck.</p>
    <p>We called the 800 number for roadside assitance numerous times early in the day and finally concluded there was no chance they were going to get someone out to service the vehicle. Luckily I have spent some time working on our own cars and my motorcycles so I started to dig in. I quickly figured out that we could still drive the vehicle by manually disabling the shift lock and we decicided to move ahead but basically lost a day because of this.</p>
    <p>We all really liked <a href={'http://timbercrestrvpark.com/'}>TimberCrest RV Park</a> and made the best of things by staying another night and checking out some of the local amish attractions.</p>
    <p>We went to <a href={'https://thefarmatwalnutcreek.com/'}>The Farm at Walnut Creek</a> and had a super fun time driving through the park safari style and feeding some of the animals.<img src={farm3} alt={'feeding some cows'}/>It's a great open area where they let many different kinds of animals roam free, and you can buy buckets of food to feed them right from your car.</p>
    <img src={farm1} alt={'llama'}/>
    <img src={farm2} alt={'bison?'}/>
    <p>After the farm we stopped at <a href={'http://walnutcreekcheese.com/'}>Walnut Creek Cheese</a> and bought some cheese curds, a few different cheeses, and some other goodies.</p>
    <p>Then we went to <a  href={'https://www.dhgroup.com'}>Der Dutchman</a> and picked up some <i>to go</i> amish fare. I had the traditional roast beef dinner which I would normally recognize as pot roast and it was damn fine.  Everyone else also enjoyed their food and we called it a night after a walk around the campground and a fire.</p>
    <h3>Day 4</h3>
    <p>Today waas Aidan's birthday! He's now 9 years old, happy birthday Aidan! Our original plan was to visit Chicago and get a hot dog. With our RV now limping and not having a very solid day planned out we decided to call an audible and instead went to the roller coaster capital of the world, <a href={'https://www.cedarpoint.com/'}>Cedar Point!</a></p>
    <p>This is not Disneyworld so when visiting be prepared for some serious roller coasters. Social distancing and masks were being enforced, and they were sanitizing the rides after people got off, so we felt really safe.</p>
    <img src={cedar} alt={'cedar point'}/>
    <p>After getting really sunburned and hitting a bunch of rides we were satisfied and headed back to the camper for much needed showers. Aidan's favorite food is tacos so I ordered some take out from <a href={'https://www.barra-sandusky.com/'}>Barra</a>. Delicious! We headed to our new campground which we weren't thrilled with as it was very expensive and packed with people. That night we stayed in the camper, enjoyed delicious tacos, and celebrated Aidan's birthday. </p>
    <img src={aidanIs9} alt={'Aidan turns 9!'}/>
    <p>The beer highlight this evening was Dortmunder Lager made by the Great Lakes Brewing Company</p>
    <img src={dortmunder} alt={'Great Lakes Brewing Co. Dortmunder Lager'}/>
    <h3>Day 5 and 6</h3>
    <p>On day 5 we really just wanted to get out of our spot at the very redneck KOA campground and headed to <a href={'https://campchautauqua.com/'}>Camp Chautauqua</a>. We still don't know  how to pronounce it, but we all liked it so much we stayed for 2 days. There were many activities like fishing and boating, and we finally encountered our first pool!</p>
    <img src={thePool} alt={'In the pool'}/>
    <p>The camp sites here were really nice, and we were not smooshed against our neighbors. The   first night we ate pizza from <a href={'http://www.andriaccios.com/'}>Andriaccio's</a> and  grilled burgers and hotdogs over the fire the next night. I found another nice beer from the Great Lakes Brewing Company... Burning River Pale Ale:</p>
    <img src={greatLakes} alt={'Burning River Pale Ale'}/>
    <h3>Day 7</h3>
    <p>On day 7 we headed out to Niagra Falls. I gotta say being there was really unenjoyable and I will probably not return. The atmosphere there feels very ghetto and there was no enforcement of social distancing. Many people were walking around with no masks, and I was not comfortable parking the RV there and walking away for an extended period of time. We stayed for about 15 minutes.</p>
    <img src={niagra} alt={'Niagra Falls'}/>
    <p>For such a famous state park and tourist attraction they really need to step up the safety and the vibe to be more family oriented.</p>
    <p>After Niagra we got some road food and headed to our next campsite at <a href={'https://countrycharmcampground.com/'}>Country Charm Campground</a>. This place is stunning and super low key. It's in the finger lakes region which I did not realize has a lot of wine producers. We grilled a melange of sausages, corn, and mushrooms and enjoyed a bottle of Salmon Run Meritage from the highly recommended Dr. Frank. It was fantastic!</p>
    <img src={drFrank} alt={'Niagra Falls'}/>
    <p>This campground is beautiful and I hope to return soon... possibly for labor day. There is a full frisbee golf setup on premise:</p>
    <img src={cc1} alt={'Country Charm Frisbee Golf'}/>
    <p>There is also a very large fishing pond and lots of space to roam around.</p>
    <img src={cc2} alt={'Country Charm roaming around'}/>
    <h3>Day 8</h3>
    <p>On day 8 we spent some time in the morning at country charm then headed back out on the road to a campground that was close to our dropoff location as this was our last night. We reupped on the poop disintegrating tablets for the toilet and went to Outback Steakhouse for a late lunch. After a reasonable socially distant meal down under we were off to <a href={'https://www.mtpoconocampground.com/'}>Mount Pocono Campground</a>. Before arriving I had read some <a  href={'https://www.yelp.com/biz/mount-pocono-campground-mount-pocono?osq=mount+pocono+campground'}>reviews</a> for this place and was a little afraid as the owner Debbie has some very harsh criticisms. We arrived late around 7pm and I was instructed by the signs to call if the office was closed so I dialed the number. Debbie answered and she sounded pissed. She told us to wait and came from her home  to the office  to take our temperature and check us in.</p>
    <p>My first words to Debbie were apologies for being late. Turns out Debbie is super nice and even opened up the pool for the kids. The reviews on yelp seemed like they were from camping noobs making dumb mistakes, so I disregarded them and will be writing a positive review soon.</p>
    <p>I found Rogue Dead Guy Ale at a nice price so it joined me at the fire.</p>
    <img src={deadGuy} alt={'Rogue Dead Guy Ale'}/>
    <p>As I was preparing the fire I noticed that included in my kindling was the local obituraries and thought Gloria Broscius or Joanna Kasian probably never thought they'd be a part of what was the best fire we had all trip long.</p>
    <img src={mtP1} alt={'Gloria & Joanna'}/>
    <img src={mtP2} alt={'Fiah!'}/>
    <p>It was a great trip overall and I highly recommend checking out the RV vacation option during these covid times. It really allows for one to get away while still being able to practice safe social distancing.</p>
    <img src={mtP3} alt={'Family Fiah!'}/>
    <small style={{paddingBottom: '60px'}}>*road food can consist of any roadside staple like McDonald's, Taco Bell, Burger King, Chick-fil-a, etc.</small>
